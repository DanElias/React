const element = <h1>Hello!</h1>
HTML code is embeded in javascript code

JSX
Syntactic extension to javascript
Notation to represent JS function calls 
that evaluate to JS objects
Avoids artificial separation of rendering logic
from other UI logic
UI and Rendering logic are seen in a single component
Not like angular that has a separate view file

JSX notation -> better
const element = {
    type: 'h1',
    props: {
        className: 'greeting',
        children: 'Hello World!'
    }
};

You can also embed js expression in jsx code
const dish = {id: 0, name:"food",...}

return (
    <div key={dish.id} className="col-12 mt-5">
)

Therefore you can call a js object in the HTML jsx
