Only class components can store state

The parent component has the data or props to be sed by serveral components
To use this you use a shared folder to share this info among components
then you import it to the parent component

So the constructor props of the child
inherits the props defined in the state of the parent

Example

App.js:
-------------------------------------------
import { DISHES } from './shared/dishes';
...
this.state = {
      dishes: DISHES
    };
...
<Menu dishes={this.state.dishes}/>
-------------------------------------------
So you import the shared data
Then define it in the parents state
Then to share it as a prop to the child, add the variable to the 
child component's tag

To access the prop in the child:
    this.props.dishes

State is important! and can change what is displayed in real time!!!
