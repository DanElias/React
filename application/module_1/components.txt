Components:

Unit that returns a group of react elements
that renders on the screen

This lets you split UI into independent 
reusable pieces

Start name with Capital letter


1. Create a new js file under src/components with the Component name
2. Import React Component
3. class Component extends Component{}
4. add contructor(props)
5. add render method with its return() which is the part that is the UI returned by the component
6. export component to be used: export default Component
7. add state to the constructor : data variables as json. state has properties which are the data variables

Map operator:
this.state.dishes.map((dish) => {
            return (

its like a for each dish in the dishes array return this UI
remember to use a key={dish.id} in the outermost <div> to identify each Menu Item with a unique IDs
